# Business Groupings

Business groupings in Yellow Pages are groups of business listings that appear within a column. Businesses are grouped alphabetically under a heading, or business type.      

When marking business groupings, you will need to identify and mark all of the businesses that appear within a column under a specific business type heading. Include the heading in your mark.    

Sometimes, there may be a heading with no businesses listed, showing a  “See also…” listing instead. Mark that listing as its own business grouping.
