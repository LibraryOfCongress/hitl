#Hi!

The Task
Your task is to identify and select different blocks of content that appear on a phone book page. For our project, we want to identify 3 types of content blocks:  
- Advertisements
- Business Listings
- Information Blocks. 

You will use the marking tool to draw rectangles around each unmarked block and then you will tag each block to let us know what type of block you think it is.   

After you have marked all of the blocks on the phone book page, click the DONE button.
