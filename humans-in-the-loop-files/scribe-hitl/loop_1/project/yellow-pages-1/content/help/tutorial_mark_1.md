# The Task
Your task is to identify and select different types of content that appear on a phone book page. For this task, there are three types of content to mark:  
- Advertisements
- Business Groupings
- Telephone Tips

You will use the marking tool to draw rectangles around each unmarked block and then you will tag each block to let us know what type of block you think it is.    

After you have marked all of the blocks on the phone book page, click the NEXT button.     

If a page is blurry, hard to read, or totally blank, select the Bad Page button and hit Next to move on to the next page.
