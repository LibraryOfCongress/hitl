# Advertisements

In the Yellow Pages, advertisement blocks appear on each page. An advertisement is a stand-alone block, usually fully enclosed by a heavy border line. Advertisements may include text and images and may span multiple columns on a page.    

Advertisements are different from smaller paid listings that appear in-line, listed alphabetically with other business listings in a group. Paid listings usually have a more narrow borders. They never span more than one column, or appear out of alphabetical order in a given business group. Here is an example of a paid listing, which should NOT be marked as advertisements:

Here are some examples of how advertisements may appear on a page:  

Within a column, alongside a column of business listings:  

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <video width="316" height="240" loop autoplay src="/images/mark_task3.mp4"></video>
</div>

Spanning multiple columns, or taking up a large portion of the page: 
 
<div class="video-wrapper">
  <video width="270" height="240" loop autoplay src="/images/mark_task4.mp4"></video>
</div>

When marking an advertisement, include the outside border of the advertisement. Mark each advertisement individually rather than in groups.  

Once youâ€™ve marked all of the advertisements on the page, click NEXT to finish your work on this page, or select another type of content block to continue marking.
