# Telephone Tips

Telephone tips are blocks of informational content that may appear anywhere on a page.  They have helpful tips about how to use or advertise in the Yellow Pages or tips on good telephone etiquette.    

These tips are interspersed throughout the listings, but do not appear on every page. When marking a telephone tip, include any outside lines or borders.
