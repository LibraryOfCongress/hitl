## A Brief Introduction to the Project

Thank you for helping the Library of Congress enrich our collections! We need your help with activities across three different workflows:  
1. **marking specific segments of phone book pages.** Look at each page and tell us what you see. You won’t be typing, just drawing boxes around different elements such as advertisements, business groupings, and telephone tips.  
2. **marking specific segments of business groupings and transcribing business types.** You will dig deeper into the business groupings identified in workflow one by drawing boxes around what you think is the “business type” (the categories used to classify business in the Yellow Pages) and the “business listings,” (individual business names, addresses, exchanges and/or phone numbers). You will be completing a crucial next step so that this information can be transcribed in the third and final workflow.  Choose between drawing boxes and typing the fields you see.   
3. **marking up and transcribing business addresses, phone numbers, and other information** using data generated from Workflow 2. Choose between drawing boxes and typing the fields you see.   

While you help us mark and transcribe, you’ll learn more about businesses in different cities and states, plus how they were represented in U.S. Telephone Directories.   

These three activities--also called “workflows”-- are part of a larger process we’re trying as we  create enhanced descriptive information for a selection of the Yellow Pages phone directories in the Library of Congress collections. To learn more, see the <a href="/#/about">About page</a>.  Or, if you’re ready to get started, jump in!  

You can think of the overall process as a chain.  We’ll need precise marks and transcriptions if we want to create useful training data that can help when we try to recognize business types, addresses, and more. We also need a pretty sizable amount of data. So, we've broken the work into 2 types of crowdsourcing tasks across 3 separate project workflows. Those workflows are represented by the activities we described above. Tasks performed  in Workflow 1 will feed the information you see in Workflow 2. Workflow 2 tasks will then feed information for the tasks performed in Workflow 3. For a deeper dive into the technical processes and workflows, see the <a href="/#/data">How it Works page</a>.  

The tasks you perform in a given workflow can follow a sequence, or they can be performed independently (feel free to focus on the type of task you enjoy best). Have fun and tell us more about what you learn by sending an email to <a href="mailto:lc-labs@loc.gov">lc-labs@loc.gov</a>.  

**A note about the content:**  The Yellow Pages are historical documents that contain racially and culturally insensitive graphics, language, outdated terminology, and other potentially triggering content. As you are performing tasks on this site, if you encounter images that you would prefer not to see, mark, or transcribe, click the DONE button on the screen at any time to move to a new image. For questions or comments regarding sensitive content, access, and use related to this collection, please contact <a href="mailto:lc-labs@loc.gov">lc-labs@loc.gov</a>.
