# Existing marks

Occasionally, you may see existing marks on a page. If the marks are correct and nothing is left to mark, click the NEXT button.    

If someone has left an incorrect mark, you can remove the mark by clicking on it and selecting the red X in the upper right corner.    

You can also hide someone elseâ€™s marks on the page using the mark toggle on the left side of the screen.
