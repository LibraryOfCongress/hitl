#Transcribe

In this task, you will transcribe the business type heading that appears in the business grouping shown. Transcribe the highlighted text exactly as you see it. The next screen of this tutorial will show some specific examples of how these might appear.     

If the text is hard to read, give it your best shot and keep going! If the text is indecipherable, mark it as illegible and move to the next entry. If there is no information highlighted to transcribe, select “Bad region” and move to the next entry.
