# The Task
Your task is to identify and select different types of information that appear in a business grouping. 

For this task, there are two types of content we need you to mark:    
- Business type headings
- Business listings

Business types are the categories that separate and help categorize business listings in the Yellow Pages. They usually appear as a heading on the page.     

Business listings are the individual business names, addresses, and phone numbers or exchanges that appear below a business type heading.     

Use the marking tool to draw rectangles around each business type heading or business listing shown. Select the tag on the right to indicate which part of the business grouping you are marking.    

After you have marked all of the content on the phone book page, click the NEXT button.     

If an image is blurry, hard to read, or totally blank, select the Bad Page button and hit Next to move on to the next page.
