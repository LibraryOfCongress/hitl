# How to mark different types of content

First, in the right panel, select the type of content you’d like to mark:    

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <video width="460" height="524" loop autoplay src="/images/mark_task2-1.mp4"></video>
</div>

Once you’ve selected the type of content you’re marking (business types or business listings), find a block of content on the page that matches the content type you selected. Click and drag your mark around the entire block, including any bounding lines (if present).   

Once you’ve marked the area around the block, click the NEXT box at the bottom right corner of your mark.   

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <video width="460" height="230" loop autoplay src="/images/mark_task2.mp4"></video>
</div>

Made a mistake? Adjust the edges of the box by clicking and dragging the dot at the corners.    

You can also remove your mark by clicking on it and selecting the red X button in the upper right corner of the mark. Once the box is cleared, you can try again.
