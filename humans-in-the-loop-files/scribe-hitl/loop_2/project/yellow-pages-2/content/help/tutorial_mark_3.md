# Business type headings

Traditionally in Yellow Page directories, individual businesses were grouped together alphabetically by business types. For example, all of the plumbing businesses might be grouped together in a directory under the heading of “Plumbers.”    

When marking a business type, include the full heading and as well as any See references that might appear below the heading.
