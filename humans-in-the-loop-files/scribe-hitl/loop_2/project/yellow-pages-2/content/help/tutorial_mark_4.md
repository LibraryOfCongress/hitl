# Business listings

A business listing may appear as a single line below a business type heading, or it may be a full block, similar to an advertisement, dedicated to a specific business within the business grouping. Similarly, some business names may be bolded, while others are not. Different businesses paid different prices to highlight and call usersâ€™ attention to their business.    

Mark each business listing separately whether it is a single line or a full block within a grouping.

If you come across a listing for a brand or a product that is sold by multiple businesses all shown in the same listing, mark that block as a business listing. An example might look like:
