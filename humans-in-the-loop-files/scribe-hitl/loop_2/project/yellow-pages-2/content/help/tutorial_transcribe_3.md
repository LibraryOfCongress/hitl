# Bad regions

The Yellow Pages project is using automated, machine learning processes to identify business type headings. Your work will help correct computer errors that occur. If you find a task where the business heading is not highlighted, but the group of business listings below it are, do not transcribe the selected region. Instead, select Bad region and move to the next entry. Your entry will help train our machines to do better next time!
