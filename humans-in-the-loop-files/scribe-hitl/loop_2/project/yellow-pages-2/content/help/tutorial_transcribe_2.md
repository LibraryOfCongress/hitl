# Transcription examples

Business headings may appear differently in different Yellow Page listings. Some common examples of headings you might find are shown below.     

When dashes appear between words in a business type heading, enter those as double dashes with no spaces:   

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <video width="460" height="299" loop autoplay src="/images/transcribe_task2.mp4"></video>
</div>

Some business type headings have no business listings below them, but are “See…” listings. See listings tell a user where to look for related businesses. Enter See listings in the second box, directly below where you usually enter business type headings.
