# Transcription examples
Business listing elements may include a variety of text styles and types in the Yellow Pages. Sometimes business information will be abbreviated. Sometimes the text will appear as all uppercase characters, other times, the text will be all lowercase. Elements may include unexpected spacing or symbols. To the best of your ability, transcribe whatever you see exactly as you see it.  

Some examples include:  

A business name in mostly lower-case with spaces between initials and an ampersand:  

<div class="modal-field-guide">
<img src="/images/transcribe_task2-1.png" alt="mark_task">
</div>

A phone number with exchange name:  
<div class="modal-field-guide">
<img src="/images/transcribe_task2-2.png" alt="mark_task">
</div>

An abbreviated business address:  
<div class="modal-field-guide">
<img src="/images/transcribe_task2-3.png" alt="mark_task">
</div>

Whatever appears in the highlighted box, that’s what you’ll transcribe. If the information is blurry or unreadable, mark that section as illegible. If you are shown more than one element or a full listing rather than a single element, mark that as Bad region and continue to the next entry.
