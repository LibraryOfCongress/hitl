# The Task
Your task is to identify and select different elements of information that appear in a single business listing. 

Here are the elements of business listings we need you to mark:    
- Business Name
- Business Address
- Phone Number
- See Advertisement
- Other Information
- Graphic

Business listings refer to the individual businesses that appear listed alphabetically by business type (for example, individual plumbing businesses might be listed alphabetically below the heading, “Plumbers.”) A business listing may appear as a single line below a business type heading or it may be a full block, also referred to as a Paid listing. Paid listings are similar to advertisements, but unlike advertisements are listed in alphabetical order with other businesses of the same type. In addition to names, addresses and phone numbers, listings often also include a note referring readers to a larger advertisement for the same business, or other information. Listings may also include images or graphics.    

Mark each business listing element that appears within the grouping shown. Identify the element you are marking on the right side of the screen.
