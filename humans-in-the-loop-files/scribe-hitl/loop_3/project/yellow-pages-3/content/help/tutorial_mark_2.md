# How to mark different elements of a listing
First, in the right panel, select the type of content you’d like to mark:  

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <video width="460" height="848" loop autoplay src="/images/mark_task2-1.mp4"></video>
</div>


Once you’ve selected the business listing element you’re marking, find a block of content on the page that matches the element you selected. Click and drag your mark around the entire element.    

Once you’ve marked the element, click the DONE box at the bottom right corner of your mark.  

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <video width="460" height="37" loop autoplay src="/images/mark_task2.mp4"></video>
</div>

Made a mistake? Adjust the edges of the box by clicking and dragging the dot at the corners.  

You can also remove your mark by clicking on it and selecting the red X button in the upper right corner of the mark. Once the box is cleared, you can try again.
