# Business names, addresses & phone numbers
The consistent elements of a business listings that will almost always be present are the business name, business address, and a phone number or exchange . Whether the listing appears as a single line of text, or in a stand-alone block, these three elements will almost certainly need to be marked.    

A full listing may be a single line that includes the business name (bolded or not), the business address (often simply a street name and number), and in older directories a telephone number or exchange:

To skip the listing, do not mark anything on the image. Instead click NEXT to load the next. An example of a brand listing that you should skip would be:
