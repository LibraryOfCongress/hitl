# Transcribe

In this task, you will transcribe the listing elements that appear. Transcribe the highlighted text exactly as you see it. The next screen of this tutorial will show some specific examples of how these might appear.   

If the text is hard to read, give it your best shot and keep going! If the text is indecipherable, mark it as illegible and move to the next entry. If there is no information highlighted to transcribe, select Bad region and move to the next entry.
