# See advertisements and other information
In addition to business names, addresses, and phone numbers, some listings also include a note to see related advertisements. These should be marked as See Advertisement.    

A “see advertisement” may refer a reader to see an advertisement for the business on the current page, or on another page in the directory:    
 
<div class="video-wrapper">
  <video width="460" height="77" loop autoplay src="/images/mark_task4-1.mp4"></video>
</div>

Other information will sometimes also appear in listings and should be marked as Other Information, as shown here:    

<div class="video-wrapper">
  <video width="460" height="284" loop autoplay src="/images/mark_task4.mp4"></video>
</div>

When marking “Other information” elements in a listing, draw a separate mark around any information that appears on its own line.   

If graphics or other logos appear in a listing, mark those as “Graphic.”
