# HITL

Code and documentation for Humans in the Loop (HITL), an LC Labs' sponsored collaboration with AVP, that explores a framework and considerations for integrating crowdsourcing and machine learning in ways that are ethical, engaging, and useful.  

The project integrated collaborative design and user research as it moved through several stages; resulting in prototype crowdsourcing workflows, training data, code, documentation, and wireframes. Ultimately, these outcomes were used to iterate toward and define a framework and recommendations for bringing these approaches together.
